Definition (datatype)
defines the kind of value a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. It helps the compiler or interpreter understand how the programmer intends to use the data.

category(Primitive & non primitive)

Primitive definition
Primitive data types are the most basic types of data. They are predefined by the language and serve as the building blocks for data manipulation.

Types
Integer Definition: Whole number without decimal Example: 10, -5, 2025.
Float Definition: Number with decimal point Example: 3.14, -0.99, 100.0.
Boolean Definition: Logical value representing true or false Example: True, False.
String Definition: Sequence of characters Example: "HELLO", "123", "WHERE911".
Undefined Definition: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value Example: let x;  x is undefined.
Null Definition: Represents an intentional absence of any object value Example: let y = null;
Symbol Definition: Unique and immutable primitive value often used as object keys Example: let sym = Symbol("id");
BigInt Definition: Represents large integers beyond the safe limit of Number Example: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n

Non Primitive definition
Complex types built using primitive types. They can store multiple values and offer more functionality.

Types
Object Definition: Collection of key-value pairs Example: { name: "Bran", age: 39 }.
Array Definition: Ordered list of values Example: [1,3,4,10,” ”,"Hello”].
RegExp Definition: Pattern used to match character combinations in strings Example: /[A-Z]{5}/
